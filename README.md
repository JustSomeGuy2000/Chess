# Chess Plus

A chess application designed to support many kinds of chess variants, with a standardised format to code your own variants. Pretty much the only things this does not support are huge modifications, multiple boards, and more than 2 players, although I'm considering adding the latter.

As a side note, I mentioned huge modifications, but it might be surprising what that counts as. For example, go (I think) and checkers are both possible. Ludo, I believe, are as well. Who knows, if 4-player bcomes a thing, Monopoly might be possible here!

But I digress. May the archons smile upn you, reader.
